# Final-Fantasy-XIII-2-Clock-Puzzle-Solver
This is a program I made to help solve a rather difficult puzzle in a video game. 
To solve the puzzle, all circles around a clock must be activated. A circle can only be activated when a hand of the clock points to it, 
with the exception of the first activation, in which any circle can be activated.
Each circle contains a number n on it. When that circle is activated, the two hands of the clock move to the circles n positions away, 
and then only those two (or one, if the two hands overlap) circles can be activated. A circle cannot be activated more than once.
In the case where no circles can be activated but there are still unactivated circles, the user loses and starts again with a new puzzle.

Here is a link to a video made by Olizandri of the puzzle described above: https://youtu.be/1M5AqlxDoRc?t=15m40s
